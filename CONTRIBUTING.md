# Contributing to SoftwareCats.GitHub.Io

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to SoftwareCats.GitHub.Io!

Since this is an enterprise website, we would not be accepting any code contributions. However, if you do experience any problems feel free to open an issue.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on our [support page](https://softwarecats.github.io/support/).

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the website? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/SoftwareCats/SoftwareCats.github.io/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/SoftwareCats/SoftwareCats.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Your browser / OS

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

  * **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the [issue tracking](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking) workflow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.

## Automated Issue Management

We use GitHub Actions to help us manage issues. These Actions and their descriptions can be [viewed here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-actions). Some examples of what these Actions do are:

* Automatically closes any issue marked `needs-more-info` if there has been no response in the past 7 days.
* Automatically lock issues 45 days after they are closed.
* Automatically implement the VS Code [feature request pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging#managing-feature-requests).

If you believe the bot got something wrong, please open a new issue and let us know.

# Thank You!
